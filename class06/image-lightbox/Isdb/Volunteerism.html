<p>Floods in Bangladesh’s northeast have spread to other districts as heavy monsoon rains continue to pummel Sylhet and Sunamganj districts, leaving millions of people stranded without power, food and drinking water. The continuous heavy rainfall in the north-eastern Indian region terribly affected more than 2 million people who live on the Surma-Kushiyara river’s bank of Bangladesh. Kanaighat, Gowainghat, Companyganj, Jaintapur, Zakiganj, Sylhet sadar, Fenchuganj, and many more upazillas of Sylhet as well as several upazilas of Sunamganj and Netrokona districts have been inundated. Meanwhile, water from the Surma River invaded buildings and stores in district. All road communications in Gowainghat upazila were disrupted. Approximately 90% of the residents of the upazila were stuck.

The Disaster Response Department of BDRCS, along with IFRC, has been monitoring the situation, updating the contingency stock and situation report as well as coordinating with BDRCS units (branches) and in-country Red Cross Red Crescent Movement partners. Considering the current flood situation, the following initial activities are being considered for quick response to the second round of flooding.

BDRCS has allocated BDT 650,000 for dry food (Sylhet BDT 200,000, Sunamganj BDT 200,000, Netrokona 100,000, Habiganj 50,000, Sherpur 50,000, and Kurigram 50,000) among the flood-affected people in particular who have taken refuge in different shelters.

Besides, BDRCS allocated BDT 900,000 (Sylhet BDT 400,000, Sunamganj BDT 300,000 and in Netrokona BDT 200,000) for the distribution of cooked food among the flood-affected people.

Free primary medical care services provided to flood victims through four medical camps. Considering the current situation, the Society has already sent four new medical teams to the affected districts.
